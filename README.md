## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DanielZerihunGeda/Telecom.git
 2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Telecom
    ```
 
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

be aware that the existing requirements.txt file includes all the packages for the project
   
If you prefer Conda as your package manager:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to your project directory.

3. Run the following command to create a new Conda environment:

    ```bash
    conda create --name your_env_name python=3.12
    ```
    Replace `your_env_name` with the desired name for your environment e.g. week0 and `3.12` with your preferred Python version.

4. Activate the environment:

    ```bash
    conda activate your_env_name
    ```
If you prefer using `venv`, Python's built-in virtual environment module:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to your project directory.

3. Run the following command to create a new virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python -m venv your_env_name
    ```

    Replace `your_env_name` with the desired name for your environment.

4. Activate the environment:

    - On Windows:

    ```bash
    .\your_env_name\scripts\activate
    ```

    - On macOS/Linux:

    ```bash
    source your_env_name/bin/activate
    ```

Now, your virtual environment is created and activated. You can install packages and run your Python scripts within this isolated environment. Don't forget to install required packages using `pip` or `conda` once the environment is activated.
